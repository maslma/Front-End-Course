<!-- Comparisons, Conditional Branching, and Logical Operators
- greater/less than (>, <)
- greater/less than or equal to (>=, <=)
- equal to (==) (===)
- not equal to (!=) (!==)

0. Boolean is The Result
- all comparisons return a boolean value.
- true - means "yes", "correct", or "the truth".
- false - means "no", "wrong", or "not the truth".
- a comparison result can be assigned to a variable.

1. String Comparison
- to see wether a string is greater than another, JavaScript uses the so-called "dictionary"
or "lexicographic" ordering (fun assignment search for it).
- in other words, strings are compared letter by letter.
- string comparison algorithm:
1. compare the first character of both strings.
2. if the first character from the first string is greater (or less), than the other 
string's, then the first string is greater (or less) than the second. We are done.
3. otherwise, if both strings' first characters are the same, compare the second characters 
the same way.
4. if both strings end at the same length, then they are equal. Otherwise, the longer 
string is greater.

2. Comparison of Different Data Types
- when comparing values of different data types, JavaScript converts the values to numbers.

3. Strict Equality
- a non-strict equality (==) has a problem, it can not differentiate between `0` from `false`.
- this happens because operands of different types are converted to numbers by the non-strict 
equality operator (==). An empty string, just like `false`, becomes a zero.
- strict equality (===) solves this problem. It checks the equality without type conversion.
- in other words if `a` and `b` are of different types, then a === b immediately returns 
false without an attempt to convert them.

4. Comparison w/ Null and Undefined
- for a strict check (===): there values are different, because each of them is a different 
type.
- for a non-strict check (==): there is a special rules, these two are a "sweet couple", 
they equal each other in the sense of ==.
- for maths and other comparisons < > <= >= null and undefined are converted to numbers: 
null becomes 0, undefined becomes NaN.

5. Strange Result: null vs. 0
- equality check (==) and comparisons (<, <=, >, >=) work differently. Comparisons convert 
null to a number, treating it as 0. Equality checks (==) for undefined and null is defined 
such that, without any conversions, they equal each other and do not equal anything else.

6. An Incomparable Undefined -> غير قابلة للمقارنة
- the value of undefined should not be compared to other values.

7. Conditional Branching
- sometimes we need to preform different actions based on different conditions. To do that, 
we use the `if` statement and the conditional operator (?:).

8. The `if` Statement
- the `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.

9. Boolean Conversion - Falsy and Truthy Values
- let us recall the conversion rules from the type conversion lecture.
- falsy values: 0, "", null, undefined, NaN, all become false.
- truthy values: everything else becomes true.

10. The `else` Statement
- the `else` statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition of the `if` 
statement is false.

11. The `else if` Statement
- the `else if` statement is used to test several variants of a condition.

12. Conditional/Question Mark/Ternary Operator (?:)
- sometimes we need to assign a variable depending on a condition.
- how many operands does it have?

13. Multiple ?: Operators

14. Logical Operators
- there are four logical operators in JavaScript: AND, OR, NOT, and Nullish Coalescing.
- although they are called logical, they can be applied to values of any type, not only 
booleans.

15. OR Operator (||)
- in classical programming, the logical OR operator is meant to manipulate boolean values 
only, if any of its operands/arguments are true, then the result is true.
- in JavaScript, it is a little bit trickier and more powerful.
- OR evaluates operands from left to right.
- it converts each operand to a boolean and finds the first truthy value in its operands 
and returns it.
- if all operands are falsy, then it returns the last operand.
- a value is returned in its original form, without conversion.

15. Short Circuit Evaluation
- it means that OR operator processes its arguments until the first truthy value is reached,
and then the value is returned immediately, without even touching the rest of the operands.

16. AND Operator (&&)
- in classical programming, the logical AND operator is meant to manipulate boolean values 
only, if all of its operands/arguments are true, then the result is true.
- AND evaluates operands from left to right.
- it converts each operand to a boolean and finds the first falsy value in its operands 
and returns it. -->
