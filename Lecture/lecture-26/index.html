17. Object Methods, `this` Keyword من اهم الاشياء الي لازم نفهمها واحنا بنتعلم الجافا سكريبت
- objects are usually created to represent entities of the real world, such as users, 
orders, etc.
- and in the real world, the user can act: select something from the shopping cart, 
log in, log out, etc.
- actions are represented in JavaScript by function.
- a function that is a property of an object is called a method.
- of course we can use a pre-declared function as a method.

17.1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- when we write our code using objects to represent entities, that is called 
object-oriented programming (OOP).
- OOP is a big thing, an interesting science of its own. How to use the right entities? 
How to organize the interactions between them? ... etc.

17.2 Method Short-Hand
- to be honest, the notations are not full identical. There are subtle differences 
related to object inheritance (will be covered later).

17.3 `this` In Methods
- it is common that an object method needs to access the information stored in the 
object to do its job.
- to access the object, a method can use the `this` keyword.
- the value of the `this` keyword is the object (for now).
- during the execution of the method, the value of `this` will be the object.
- technically, it is also possible to access the object without `this`. But...

17.4 `this` Is Not Bound
- in JavaScript, the `this` keyword behaves unlike other programming languages. It can 
be used in any function, even if it is not a method.
- the value of `this` is evaluated during the run-time, depending on the context. 
But.. what context?
- global functions context: in strict mode, the `this` keyword is `undefined`, 
in non-strict mode, it is the global object `window`.

17.5 Arrow Functions Have No `this`
- arrow functions do not have their own `this` keyword. When we reference `this` 
inside an arrow function, it refers to the outer "normal" function.

18. Constructor, Operator `new`
- the regular {...} syntax allows us to create on object, but often we need to create 
many similar objects, like multiple users, menu items, and so on.
- that can be done using constructors functions and "new" operator.
- a constructor function is technically a function with tow conventions: 
1. they are named with a capital letter first. 
2. they should be executed using the `new` operator.

18.1 What Happens When We Use `new` With A Constructor Function?
1. the `new` operator creates a new empty object and assigns it to `this`.
2. the function body executes.
3. the function returns the `this` value.

- this is the main purpose of constructors: to create and object and return it 
(in order to implement reusable object creation code).
- technically, any function can be used as a constructor 
(except for the arrow functions).

18.2 Constructor Mode Test: `new.target`

18.3 Return From Constructors

18.4 Omitting Parentheses

18.5 Methods In Constructor

19. Optional Chaining
- the optional chaining `?.` is a safe way to access nested object properties, even if an intermediate property does not exist.
