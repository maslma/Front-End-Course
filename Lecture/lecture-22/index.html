6. Function Expressions
- in JavaScript, a function is not a magical language structure, but a special kind of value.
- the syntax we used before is called a function declaration.
- there is another syntax for creating a function, called a function expression.
- it allows us to create a function in the middle of any expression.
- example: create a function and assign it to a variable.

7. Function is a Value
- no matter how the function is created, it is a value.
- we can copy the function to another variable.

8. Callback Functions
- the idea is we pass a function as an argument to another function and we expect it to 
be called back later if necessary.

Exercise:
- create a function that takes four parameters:
1. a: number
2. b: number
3. firstFn: a function that will do an arithmetic operation with the two numbers.
4. secondFn: a function that will do another arithmetic operation with the two numbers.

Exercise 02:
- create a function that takes three parameters:
- a: a question
- b: a function to be executed if the user confirmed the question.
- c: a function to be executed if the user denied the question.

9. Function Declarations vs Function Expressions

9.1 Syntax
- function declaration: function name (parameters) { body }
- a function declared as a separate statement, in the main code flow.
- function expression: function (parameters) { body }
- a function created inside an expression or inside another syntax construct.

9.2 Creation
- another subtle difference is when a function is created by the JavaScript engine.
- a function declaration can be called earlier than it is defined.
- that is due to internal algorithms, when JavaScript prepares the whole script, it first looks for global Function Declarations and creates them.
- a function expression is created when the execution reaches it and it is usable only from that moment.

10. Arrow Functions
- there is another very simple and concise syntax for creating functions. That is often better than Function Expressions.
- it is called Arrow Functions.
- the syntax is: parameter => body
- arrow functions can be used in the same places as function expressions.
