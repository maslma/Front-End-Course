 22. Strings
- in JavaScript textual data is stored as strings, there is not separate type for a 
single character.
- quotes: single, double, and back-ticks. single and double are essentially the same. 
back-ticks allow us to embed any expression into the string, by wrapping it in ${...}.
- another advantage of using back-ticks is that they allow a string to span multiple 
lines.

22.1 Special Characters
- it is still possible to create multi-line strings with single and double quotes by 
using so-called "new-line character" written as "\n", which denotes a line break.

character    description
\n           new line
\' \" \`     quote (escape quote)
\\           back-slash (escape back-slash)
\t           tab

- as you can see, all special characters start with a back-slash character (\). 
it is also called an "escape character".

22.2 String Length
- `length` property has the string length: `"Shawqi".length` -> 6

22.3 Accessing Characters
- to get a character at position (index), use square brackets `[index]` or call the 
`at(index)` method. the first character starts from the zero position/index.

let string = "Shawqi";
string[0]; -> "S"
string.at(0); -> "S"
string[length - 1]; -> "i"
string.at(-1); -> "i"

- iterate over characters using `for..of`:

for (const character of string) {
  console.log(string[character])
}

22.4 Strings Are Immutable
- strings can not be changed in JavaScript. it is impossible to change a character.

string[0] = "s"; -> error

22.5 Changing The Case `toLowerCase()` and `toUpperCase()`

22.6 Searching For Sub-Strings `indexOf()`, `lastIndexOf()`, `includes()`, `startsWith()` and `endsWith()`

22.7 Getting a Sub-String `slice()`, `substring()`, and `substr()`
- `slice(start, end)`:
returns the part of the string from `start` to `end` (not including end).
if there is no `end` slice goes till the end of the string.
negative values mean the position is counted from the end of the string.

- `substring(start, end)`:
returns the part of the string between `start` and `end` (not including end).
this is almost the same as `slice()` but it allows the `start` to be greater than the `end`.
negative values are not supported.

- `substr(start, length)`:
returns the part of the string from `start` with the given `length`.
negative values are allowed for `start`.

22.8 Trimming String `trim()`

23. Arrays
- objects allow us to store keyed collections of values.
- what if we need an ordered collection where we have a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd element and so on to store list of things in order.
- we can not use objects here because they are not ordered, they do not provide methods to manage the order of elements, or to elements at the beginning, at the end, or even between existing elements.

23.1 Arrays Declaration
- like objects:

const array = new Array();
const array = [];

- almost all the time, the second syntax is used. we can supply initial elements in the brackets.

const array = ["Shawqi", "Hatem", "Something"];

- array elements are numbered, starting with zero. we can get an elements by its number in square brackets.

console.log(array[0]); -> "Shawqi"

- we can replace elements.

array[0] = "Other Name";
-> ["Other Name", "Hatem", "Something"]

- or add a new one to the array.

array[3] = "Fares";
-> ["Other Name", "Hatem", "Something", "Fares"]

- the total count of the elements in the array is its `length`.

array.length -> 4.

- an array can store elements of any type.
- for negative index values we use `at()` method.

23.2 A Queue and A Stack: Pop, Push, Shift, and Un-Shift
- a queue is one of the most common uses of an array. in computer science this means an ordered collection of elements which supports two operations:
1. push: appends an elements to the end.
2. shift: get an element from the beginning, advancing the queue, so the the 2nd element becomes the 1st.
- arrays support both operations.

- a stack supports two operations:
1. push: appends an element to the end.
2. pop: takes an element from the end.
- for stacks, the latest pushed item is received first, that is also called LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. for queues, we have FIFO (First-In-First-Out).

- arrays in JavaScript can work both as a queue and as a stack. they allow you to add/remove elements, both to/from the beginning or the end.
- in computer science, the data structure that allows this, is called dequeue.

- `pop`: extracts the last element of the array and returns it.
- `push`: append the elements to the end of the array.
- `shift`: extracts the first element of the array and returns it.
- `unshift`: add the element to the beginning of the array.

- `push` and `unshift` can add multiple elements at once.

23.3 Internals
- an array is a special kind of object. the square brackets used to access a property `array[0]` actually come from the object syntax. that is essentially the same as `object[key]` where `array` is the object while numbers (indexes) are used as keys.
- they extend objects providing special methods to work with the ordered collections of data and also the `length` property. but at the core it is still an object.

- but what makes arrays really special in their internal representation? the engine tries to store its elements in the contiguous memory area, one after another, and there are other optimizations as well, to make arrays work really fast.

- but they all break if we quit working with an array as with an ordered collection and start working with it as if it were a regular object. the engine will see that we are working with the array as wit ha regular object. array-specific optimizations are not suited for such cases and will be turned off, their benefits disappear.

- the ways to misuse an array:
1. add a non-numeric properties like `array.test = 5`.
2. make holes, like: add `array[0]` and then `array[1000]` (and nothing between them).
3. fill the array in the reverse order.

- please think of arrays as special structures to work with the ordered data. they provide special methods for that. arrays are carefully tuned inside JavaScript engines to work with contiguous ordered data, please use them this way. and if you need arbitrary keys, chances are high that you actually require a regular object.

23.4 Performance
- methods `push`/`pop` run fast, while `shift`/`unshift` are slow.
- why it is faster to work with the end of an array than with its beginning?
- the `shift` operation must do three things here: `array.shift()`
1. remove the element with the index 0.
2. move all elements to the left, re-number them from the index 1 to 0, from 2 to 1, and so on.
3. Update the `length` property.

- the more elements in the array the more time to move them, more in-memory operations.

- the similar thing happens with `unshift`, to add an element to the beginning of the array we need first to move existing elements to the right, increasing their indexes.

- `push`/`pop` do not need to move anything, to extract an element from the end, the `pop` method cleans the index and shortens `length`.

- again, the `pop` method does not need to move anything because other elements keep their indexes. that is why it is blazingly fast.

23.5 Loops `for..in` and `for..of`
- the loop `for..in` iterates over all properties not only the numeric ones.
- there are so-called "array-like" objects in the browser and in other environments, that look like arrays. that is, they have `length` and indexes properties, but they may also have other non-numeric properties and methods, which we usually do not need.
- the `for..in` loop will list them though. so if we need to work with array-like objects, then these extra properties can become a problem.
- the `for..in` loop is optimized for generic objects, not arrays, and thus is 10-100 times slower. of course it is still fast, but we should be aware of the difference.
- generally, we should not use `for..in` for arrays.

23.6 A Word About `length` and Truncating/Clearing Arrays

23.7 `new Array()`

23.8 Multi-Dimensional Arrays

23.9 `toString`

23.10 Do Not Compare Arrays With `=`

24. Array Methods
- how to delete an element from the array? the arrays are objects so we can use `delete` but the array will still have the same length, because delete removes a value by the key. this is fine for objects but for arrays we usually want the rest of the elements to shift and occupy the freed place. we expect to have a shorter array now.

24.1 `splice()`, `slice()`, and `concat()`
- `array.splice(start, count, element_1, element_2, elements...)`: it modifies `array` starting from the index `start` removes `count` elements and inserts element_1 and 2 if they exists at their place. returns an array of the removed elements.
- `slice(start, end)`: it returns a new array copying to it all items from index `start` to `end` (not including end).
- negative values are allowed in both methods.
