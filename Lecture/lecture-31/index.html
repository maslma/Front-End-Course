 22. Strings
- in JavaScript textual data is stored as strings, there is not separate type for a 
single character.
- quotes: single, double, and back-ticks. single and double are essentially the same. 
back-ticks allow us to embed any expression into the string, by wrapping it in ${...}.
- another advantage of using back-ticks is that they allow a string to span multiple 
lines.

22.1 Special Characters
- it is still possible to create multi-line strings with single and double quotes by 
using so-called "new-line character" written as "\n", which denotes a line break.

character    description
\n           new line
\' \" \`     quote (escape quote)
\\           back-slash (escape back-slash)
\t           tab

- as you can see, all special characters start with a back-slash character (\). 
it is also called an "escape character".

22.2 String Length
- `length` property has the string length: `"Shawqi".length` -> 6

22.3 Accessing Characters
- to get a character at position (index), use square brackets `[index]` or call the 
`at(index)` method. the first character starts from the zero position/index.

let string = "Shawqi";
string[0]; -> "S"
string.at(0); -> "S"
string[length - 1]; -> "i"
string.at(-1); -> "i"

- iterate over characters using `for..of`:

for (const character of string) {
  console.log(string[character])
}

22.4 Strings Are Immutable
- strings can not be changed in JavaScript. it is impossible to change a character.

string[0] = "s"; -> error

22.5 Changing The Case `toLowerCase()` and `toUpperCase()`

22.6 Searching For Sub-Strings `indexOf()`, `lastIndexOf()`, `includes()`, `startsWith()` and `endsWith()`

22.7 Getting a Sub-String `slice()`, `substring()`, and `substr()`
- `slice(start, end)`:
returns the part of the string from `start` to `end` (not including end).
if there is no `end` slice goes till the end of the string.
negative values mean the position is counted from the end of the string.

- `substring(start, end)`:
returns the part of the string between `start` and `end` (not including end).
this is almost the same as `slice()` but it allows the `start` to be greater than the `end`.
negative values are not supported.

- `substr(start, length)`:
returns the part of the string from `start` with the given `length`.
negative values are allowed for `start`.

22.8 Trimming String `trim()`
