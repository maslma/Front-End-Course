15. Garbage Collection
- memory management in JavaScript is performed automatically and invisibly to us. we create 
primitives, objects, functions... all that takes memory.
- what happens when something is not needed anymore? how does JavaScript engine discover it
and clean it up?
- the main concept of memory management in JavaScript is reachability.
- simply put, "reachable" values are those that are accessible or usable somehow. they are 
guaranteed to be stored in memory.

A) there is a base set of inherently reachable values, they can not be deleted for obvious 
reasons:
1. the currently executing function, its local variables and parameters.
2. other functions on the current chain of nested calls, their local variables and 
parameters.
3. global variables.
4. others - we will explain them later.

- these values are called "roots".

B) any other value is considered reachable if it is from a root by a reference or by a 
chain of references.

16. Internal Algorithms
- the basic garbage collection algorithm is called "mark and sweep".
1. the garbage collector takes roots and "marks" remember them.
2. then it visits and "marks" all the references from them.
3. then it visits marked objects and marks their references. all visited objects are 
remembered, so as not to visit the same object twice in the future.
4. ...and so on until every reachable (from the roots) references are visited.
5. all objects except marked ones are deleted.

- that is the concept of how garbage collection works. JavaScript engines apply many 
optimizations to make it run faster and do not introduce any delays in the code execution.

- some of the optimizations are:
1. generational collection. // old اكتر من new وبتركز على  old & new object الى object  بتقسم ال 
2. incremental collection. // algorithms الى اكتر من  process بتقسم ال 
3. idle-time collection. // CPU بمعنى الى علاقة في حالة idle يكون CPU بتتنفذ في حالة 

17. Object Methods, `this` Keyword
- objects are usually created to represent entities of the real world, such as users, 
orders, etc.
- and in the real world, the user can act: select something from the shopping cart, log in, 
log out, etc.
- actions are represented in JavaScript by function.
- a function that is a property of an object is called a method.
- of course we can use a pre-declared function as a method.

17.1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- when we write our code using objects to represent entities, that is called object-oriented
programming (OOP).
- OOP is a big thing, an interesting science of its own. How to use the right entities? 
How to organize the interaction between them? ... etc.

17.2 Method Short-Hand
- to be honest, the notations are not full identical. There are subtle differences related 
to object inheritance (will be covered later).

17.3 `this` In Methods
- it is common that an object method needs to access the information stored in the object 
to do its job.
- to access the object, a method can use the `this` keyword.
- the value of the `this` keyword is the object (for now).
- during the execution of the method, the value of `this` will be the object.
- technically, it is also possible to access the object without `this`. But...

17.4 `this` Is Not Bound
- in JavaScript, the `this` keyword behaves unlike other programming languages. It can be 
used in any function, even if it is not a method.
- the value of `this` is evaluated during the run-time, depending on the context. But.. 
what context?
- global functions context: in strict mode, the `this` keyword is `undefined`, in non-strict
mode, it is the global object `window`.

17.5 Arrow Functions Have No `this`
- arrow functions do not have their own `this` keyword. When we reference `this` inside an 
arrow function, it refers to the outer "normal" function.

18. Constructor, Operator `new`
- the regular {...} syntax allows us to create on object, but often we need to create many 
similar objects, like multiple users, menu items, and so on.
- that can be done using constructors functions and "new" operator.
- a constructor function is technically a function with tow conventions: 1. they are named 
with a capital letter first. 2. they should be executed using the `new` operator.

18.1 What Happens When We Use `new` With A Constructor Function?
1. the `new` operator creates a new empty object and assigns it to `this`.
2. the function body executes.
3. the function returns the `this` value.

- this is the main purpose of constructors: to create and object and return it (in order to 
implement reusable object creation code).

- technically, any function can be used as a constructor (except for the arrow functions).

18.2 Constructor Mode Test: `new.target`
