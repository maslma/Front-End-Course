20. Methods Of Primitives
- JavaScript allows us to work with primitives as if they were objects.
- it also provides methods to call as such.
- but how does it work if primitives are not objects?

20.1 A Primitive As An Object
- a paradox faced by the creator of JavaScript.
- these are many things one would want to do with a primitive, like a string or a number.
- it would be great to access them using methods.
- primitives must be as fast and lightweight as possible.

- the solution? primitives are still primitive, a single value, as desired.
- the language allows access to methods and properties of strings, numbers, and booleans.
- in order for that to work, a special "object wrapper" that provides the extra functionality is created, and then is destroyed.

- the "object wrapper" are different for each primitive type and are called `String`, `Number`, and `Boolean`.

- `let text = "Hello";`
- `text.toUpperCase();`

- the string `text` is a primitive.
- the moment of accessing its property, a special object is created that knows the value of the string, and has useful methods like `toUpperCase()`.
- the methods runs and returns a new string.
- then the special object is destroyed, leaving the primitive `text` alone.

- so primitives can provide methods, but they still remain lightweight.

- constructors `String`, `Number`, and `Boolean` are for internal use only.
- null/undefined have no methods.

21. Numbers
- more ways to write a number.
- hex, binary, and octal. (fun assignment).

21.1 Rounding
- `Math.floor()`, `Math.ceil()`, `Math.round()`, and `Math.trunc()`.
- `toFixed(n)`.

21.2 Imprecise Calculations (we will cover it later).

21.3 `isNaN` and `isFinite`

21.4 `parseInt` and `parseFloat`

21.5 `Math.random()`

21.6 `Math.max()` and `Math.min()` 

21.7 `Math.pow()
