18. Constructor, Operator `new`
- the regular {...} syntax allows us to create on object, but often we need to create many 
similar objects, like multiple users, menu items, and so on.
- that can be done using constructors functions and "new" operator.
- a constructor function is technically a function with two conventions:
 1. they are named with a capital letter first. 
 2. they should be executed using the `new` operator.

18.1 What Happens When We Use `new` With A Constructor Function?
1. the `new` operator creates a new empty object and assigns it to `this`.
2. the function body executes.
3. the function returns the `this` value.

- this is the main purpose of constructors: to create an object and return it (in order to 
implement reusable object creation code).

- technically, any function can be used as a constructor (except for the arrow functions).

18.2 Constructor Mode Test: `new.target`

18.3 Return From Constructors

18.4 Omitting Parentheses

18.5 Methods In Constructor

19. Optional Chaining
- the optional chaining `?.` is a safe way to access nested object properties, even if an 
intermediate property does not exist.

19.2 Short-Circuiting
