20. Methods Of Primitives
- JavaScript allows us to work with primitives as if they were objects.
- it also provides methods to call as such.
- but how does it work if primitives are not objects?
- a primitive is a value of a single thing (string, number, bigint, boolean, symbol,
 null, and undefined).
- an object is capable of storing multiple values as properties ({name: "Shawqi"}).
- there is other kinds of objects in JavaScript such as functions and arrays.
- one of the best things about objects is that we can store a function as one of its 
properties (we called it methods).
- there are many built-in objects already exists and they have different properties 
and methods (we will discover them soon).
- but their features come with a cost, objects are heavier than primitives, they 
require additional resources to support the internal machinery.

20.1 A Primitive As An Object
- a paradox faced by the creator of JavaScript.
- there are many things one would want to do with a primitive, like a string or a 
number.
- it would be great to access them using methods.
- also, primitives must be as fast and light-weight as possible.
- the solution? primitives are still primitive, a single value, as desired.
- the language allows access to methods and properties of strings, numbers, and 
booleans.
- in order for that to work, a special "object wrapper" that provides the extra 
functionality is created, and then is destroyed.
- the "object wrappers" are different for each primitive type and are called 
`String`, `Number`, and `Boolean`.

- for example, a string is a primitive.
- the moment of accessing its property, a special object is created that knows the 
value of the string, and has useful methods like `toUpperCase()`.
- the methods run and return a new string.
- then the special object is destroyed, leaving the primitive `text` alone.
- so primitives can provide methods, but they still remain light-weight.
- the JavaScript engine highly optimizes this process, it may even skip the creation 
of the extra object at all, but it must still adhere to the specification and behave 
as if it creates one.
- constructors `String`, `Number`, and `Boolean` are for internal use only.
- some languages like Java allow us to explicitly create "wrapper objects" for 
primitives using a syntax like `new Number(1)`, in JavaScript that is also possible 
for historical reasons, but highly unrecommended, things will go crazy in several 
places.
- null/undefined have no methods. they are the exceptions, they have no corresponding 
"wrapper objects" and provide no methods.

20.2 Tasks:
- can you add a string property?

let string = "Hello";
string.number = 8;
console.log(string.number);

21. Numbers
- in modern JavaScript there are two types of numbers: regular numbers and BigInt 
numbers.
- more ways to write a number:
1. underscore syntactic sugar: 1_000_000.
2. `e` syntactic sugar: 1e9 -> 1_000_000_000 / 1-e3 -> 0.001.
3. `toString`, Hex, Binary, and Octal Numbers (fun assignment, search for it).

21.1 Rounding
- rounding is one of the most used operations when working with numbers.
- `Math` is one of the built-in objects in JavaScript.
- `Math.floor()` rounds down: 3.1 becomes 3, -1.1 becomes -2.
- `Math.ceil()` rounds up: 3.1 becomes 4, -1.1 becomes 1.
- `Math.round()` rounds to the nearest integer: 3.1 becomes 3, 3.6 becomes 4. In the 
middle case 3.5 becomes 4 and -3.5 becomes -3.
- `Math.trunc()` removes anything after the decimal point without rounding 3.1 
becomes 3, -1.1 becomes 1.
- `toFixed(n: number)` rounds the number to `n` digits after the point and returns a 
string representation of the result. if the decimal part is shorter than required, 
zeros are appended to the end.

22.2 Imprecise Calculations
- internally, a (regular) number (not BigInt) is represented in 64-bit format, so 
there are exactly 64 bits to store a number: 52 of them are used to store the digits, 
11 of them store the position of the decimal point, and 1 bit is for the sign.
- if a number is really huge, it may overflow the 64-bit storage and become a 
special numeric value `Infinity`.
- it happens quite often the loss of precision.
- consider this: 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 (false?)
/ 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.30000000000000004 (true?).
- why does this happen? a number is stored in memory in its binary form, a sequence 
of bits - ones and zeros. but frictions like 0.1 and 0.2 that look simple in the 
decimal numeric system are actually unending frictions in their binary form.
- 0.1 is 1/10, one-tenth in the decimal numeric system, such numbers are easily 
representable. compare it to 1/3 one-third. it becomes an endless fraction 
0.333333(3).
- so division by powers 10 is guaranteed to work well in the decimal system, 
but division by 3 is not. For the same reason, in the binary numeric system, 
the division by powers of 2 is guaranteed to work well, but 1/10 becomes an endless 
binary fraction.
- there is no way to store exactly 0.1 or exactly 0.2 using the binary system, just 
like there is no way to store one-third as a decimal friction.
- the numeric format (IEEE-754) solves this by rounding to the nearest possible 
number. these rounding rules normally do not allow us to see that "tiny precision 
loss", but it exists.
- we can see this in actions using `0.1.toFixed(20)`. and when we sum two numbers, 
their "precision loss" add up. that is why 0.1 + 0.2 is not exactly 0.3.
- not only JavaScript has this issue. it exists in many other programming languages.

21.3 `isNaN` and `isFinite`
- `NaN`, `Infinity`, and `-Infinity` are special numeric values but not normal numbers, so there are special functions to check for them: `isNaN` and `isFinite`.
- `isNaN` converts its argument to a number and then tests it for being `NaN`.
- `isFinite` converts its argument to a number and returns true if it is a regular number.
- but do we need these functions? can not we just use the comparison `number === NaN`? unfortunately not, the value `NaN` is a unique in that it does not equal any thing including it self.

21.4 `Number.isNaN()` and `Number.isFinite()`
- the more strict versions of `isNaN` and `isFinite` functions.
- they do not auto convert their argument into a number, but check if it belongs to the number type instead.

21.4 `parseInt()` and `parseFloat()`
- they read a number from a string until they can not.
- `parseInt()` reads integers, `parseFloat()` reads floating-point numbers.
- `parseInt("100rem")` -> 100
- `parseFloat("100.20rem")` -> 100.20
- `parseInt("A100.20rem")` -> NaN

21.5 `Math.random()`, `Math.max()`, `Math.min()`, and `Math.pow()`
