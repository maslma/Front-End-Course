<!-- 14. Logical Operators
- there are four logical operators in JavaScript: AND, OR, NOT, and Nullish Coalescing.
- although they are called logical, they can be applied to values of any type, not only 
booleans.

15. OR Operator (||)
- in classical programming, the logical OR operator is meant to manipulate boolean values 
only, if any of its operands/arguments are true, then the result is true.
- in JavaScript, it is a little bit trickier and more powerful.
- OR evaluates operands from left to right.
- it converts each operand to a boolean and finds the first truthy value in its operands 
and returns it.
- if all operands are falsy, then it returns the last operand.
- a value is returned in its original form, without conversion.

15. Short Circuit Evaluation
- it means that OR operator processes its arguments until the first truthy value is reached,
and then the value is returned immediately, without even touching the rest of the operands.

16. AND Operator (&&)
- in classical programming, the logical AND operator is meant to manipulate boolean values 
only, if all of its operands/arguments are true, then the result is true.
- AND evaluates operands from left to right.
- it converts each operand to a boolean and finds the first falsy value in its operands and 
returns it.
- if all operands are truthy, then it returns the last operand.
- a value is returned in its original form, without conversion.

17. Precedence Of AND Is Higher Than OR

18. Do Not Replace `if` with `&&` and `||`

19. NOT Operator (!)
- the boolean NOT operator is represented with the exclamation mark (!).
- it converts its operand to a boolean and returns the inverse value.
- a double NOT (!!) converts its operand to a boolean.
- the precedence of NOT is higher than that of AND and OR.

20. Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)
- in short, the value is defined if it is not `null` or `undefined`.
- it returns the first operand that is not `null` or `undefined`.
- the common use of this operator is to provide a default value for a variable.
- in a sequence of ?? operators, the first operand that is not `null` or `undefined` is 
returned. Otherwise, the last operand is returned.
