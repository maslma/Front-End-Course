Loops: While and For, Switch Statement
- we often need to repeat actions. For example, outputting goods from a list one after another or just running 
the same code for each number from 1 to 10.
- Loops are a way to repeat the same code multiple times.

0. The `while` Loop
- while the condition is true, the code inside the loop is executed.
- a single execution of the loop is called a "loop iteration".
- any expression or variable can be a loop condition, not just comparisons: the condition is evaluated and 
converted to a boolean by while.

1. The `do ... while` Loop
- the condition is evaluated after the loop is executed.
- this form of syntax should only be used when you want the body of the loop to execute at least once 
regardless of the condition being truthy.

2. The `for` Loop
- the `for` loop is more complex, but it is the most commonly used loop.
- for (begin; condition; step (increment/decrement or anything you want)) { body }
- begin: executes once upon entering the loop.
- condition: checked before every loop iteration.
- body: runs again and again while the condition is truthy.
- step: executes after the body on each loop iteration.

3. Skipping Parts Of `for` Loop/Breaking The Loop/Continuing The Loop
- normally, a loop exits when its condition becomes falsy, but we can exit at any time using the special 
`break` statement.
- we can also exit the current iteration of the loop using the `continue` statement.

4. Switch Statement
- A `switch` statement can replace multiple `if` statements.
- if there is no `break` then the execution continues with the next `case` without any checks.
- expressions can be a `switch`/`case` argument.
- `case` can be grouped together.
- `switch` uses `===` operator for comparisons. -->
